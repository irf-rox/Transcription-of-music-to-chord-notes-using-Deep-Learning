## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/irf-rox/Transcription-of-music-to-chord-notes-using-Deep-Learning.git
   cd Transcription-of-music-to-chord-notes-using-Deep-Learning
   ```



2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```



3. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



*Note: If `requirements.txt` is not present, manually install necessary packages such as `numpy`, `librosa`, `tensorflow` or `pytorch`, `tkinter`, etc.*

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Generate Dataset**

   Use the `dataset_creater.py` script to process audio files and create datasets for training:

   ```bash
   python dataset_creater.py
   ```



2. **Train the Model**

   Train the deep learning model using the prepared dataset:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```



The trained model will be saved in the `saved_models/` directory.

3. **Run the Application**

   Launch the GUI application to transcribe new audio samples:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```



Use the interface to load audio files and view the transcribed chord sequences.
